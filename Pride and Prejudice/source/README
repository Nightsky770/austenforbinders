You do not need the LaTeX originals unless you are preparing your own version. I have *not* included the raw image files here; the Internet Archive hosts the scans I used at: https://archive.org/embed/prideprejudice00aust

I'm now using sty files. Put them wherever your LaTeX installation expects to find sty files.
