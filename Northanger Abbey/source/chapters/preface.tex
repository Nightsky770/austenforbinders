\addchap{Advertisement by the Authoress}

\vfill
\lettrine{T}{his} little work was finished in the year 1803, and intended for immediate
publication. It was disposed of to a bookseller, it was even advertised, and
why the business proceeded no farther, the author has never been able to learn.
That any bookseller should think it worth-while to purchase what he did not
think it worth-while to publish seems extraordinary. But with this, neither the
author nor the public have any other concern than as some observation is
necessary upon those parts of the work which thirteen years have made
comparatively obsolete. The public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen
years have passed since it was finished, many more since it was begun, and that
during that period, places, manners, books, and opinions have undergone
considerable changes.
