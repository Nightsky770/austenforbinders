<h2><a id="link2H_4_0032"></a> A NOTE ON THE TEXT</h2>
<p>
Northanger Abbey was written in 1797-98 under a different title. The manuscript
was revised around 1803 and sold to a London publisher, Crosbie &amp; Co., who
sold it back in 1816. The Signet Classic text is based on the first edition,
published by John Murray, London, in 1818â€”the year following Miss
Austen's death. Spelling and punctuation have been largely brought into
conformity with modern British usage.
