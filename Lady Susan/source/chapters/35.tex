\chapter{Lady~Susan to Mr~De Courcy}
  
  \begin{mail}{Upper Seymour Street.}{}

I will not attempt to describe my astonishment in reading the note this moment received from you. I am bewildered in my endeavours to form some rational conjecture of what Mrs~Mainwaring can have told you to occasion so extraordinary a change in your sentiments. Have I not explained everything to you with respect to myself which could bear a doubtful meaning, and which the ill-nature of the world had interpreted to my discredit? What can you now have heard to stagger your esteem for me? Have I ever had a concealment from you? Reginald, you agitate me beyond expression, I cannot suppose that the old story of Mrs~Mainwaring's jealousy can be revived again, or at least be \textit{listened} to again. Come to me immediately, and explain what is at present absolutely incomprehensible. Believe me, the single word of \textit{Langford} is not of such potent intelligence as to supersede the necessity of more. If we \textit{are} to part, it will at least be handsome to take your personal leaveâ€”but I have little heart to jest; in truth, I am serious enough; for to be sunk, though but for an hour, in your esteem is a humiliation to which I know not how to submit. I shall count every minute till your arrival.
