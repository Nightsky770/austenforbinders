# austenforbinders
The works of Jane Austen, typeset and imposed and ready to be printed and bound. All are available in US letter and A4 format.

Text and illustrations are in the public domain in the United States.

Fonts used, to the best of my knowledge, are free to use for any purpose including commercial. Whatever original work of mine this effort represents, I place into the public domain. In other words, to the best of my knowledge you *may* make and sell copies. I am not a lawyer and you are responsible for compliance with your government's copyright laws.

_**I have assumed throughout that you are using borderless printing**._ If your printer adds a border, you will need to make adjustments--the easiest way I've found is to increase BCOR by $borderwidth*2. For my own use (my own printer does not support borderless printing) I also set DIV to an artificially high 15, for smaller margins (since these will be enlarged in printing).

Source files (top-level and per-chapter files) are in the source directory for each book. You do not need them unless you are preparing your own version. I am using LuaLaTeX.
